# Contract source

`customer.yaml` is an exact copy of `openapi/customer.yaml` from the local,
unreleased canonical `SkyPorch/daykeeper-openapi` commit
`f7771f5ce1d48140ddbf38a113aeec60651b8d79`. No release tag exists for this
commit.

The contract adds mutually exclusive positive `before` and `after` message
cursors. The initial read returns the latest 20 customer-visible messages in
ascending order; `before` returns up to 20 older messages; `after` returns up to
20 newer messages. Each response is capped at 768 KiB of UTF-8 JSON: initial and
older pages keep the newest contiguous suffix that fits, while newer pages keep
the oldest prefix. If one message alone exceeds the cap, the gateway returns
`413 message_too_large`. Clients should continue loading older pages until an
empty page, since a short page alone does not prove exhaustion after defensive
filtering.

This local snapshot is unreleased and is not a release provenance claim. Before
publishing, replace the local commit reference with an approved immutable
contract tag and its full commit SHA, then rerun the generated type and package
checks. A hash match does not certify backend compatibility.
